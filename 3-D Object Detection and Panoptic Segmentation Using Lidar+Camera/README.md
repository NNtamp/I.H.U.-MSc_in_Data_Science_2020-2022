# 3-D Object Detection and Panoptic Segmentation Using Lidar+Camera

The general structure of the current repo is the following:

1. Use the "3-D Object Detection of Cars using Lidar+Cameras" repo for performing the 3-D object detection of cars using the SFD model
2. Use the "Panoptic Segmntation on Coco dataset" repo to perform a panoptic segmentation on the same images as above using the Detectron2 model
3. Use the "Combined visualization of SFD+Detectron2 models" repo to combine the output results in a single image
